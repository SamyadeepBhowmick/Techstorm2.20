            Objective<br/>
            Science always reveals a new truth, a new discovery, an
            unknown reality. As the necessities change and so the
            inventions and development. It keeps growing and can never
            be dull and boring. Science exhibitions explore the creative
            talent of the students and force them to think outside of the
            box. Science exhibitions develop a scientific spirit and
            curiosity in a student which in turn forces them to think and
            
            creatively find solutions to the challenges. Students enjoy
            learning through such exhibitions and feel a sense of
            belonging as they make the models with their own hands.<br/><br/>
